Hello!

Now that you have learned about WHERE clauses, it's time for some practice


Use WHERE to select all married employees from the HumanResources.Employee table.

If you need a hint, married employees have an "M" as their marital status.


Next, look in the HumanResources.EmployeeDepartmentHistory table for each Employee's current Department.

The Department is current if the EndDate field is NULL.

Remember you can't use equal(=) or not equal(<>) comparison operators to check if a field is null.


Good Luck!
